# Personal-Web
This web page I wrote is the first version of my personal web page. It is a place where I can put and add my portfolio, and a good place for others to know me.

I drawed three pictures concering the structures for each page's layout. It's a good practice for web front-end technologies.

In the following days, I learned to use bootstrap, AngularJS and other frameworks. So the first version of my website is abandoned and you can check for the new version of my personal page at: http://wwww.shulinqian.com.
